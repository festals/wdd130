                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Our family business was started in 1960 by my grandfather, who grew up in this region and decided that his passion should be shared with other. He loves outdoor sport and teaching other how to appreciates what natures gaves us.
                    He also loved having fun and water rafting is a mixte of all that. We grew this business as family and when my father decided to retire, he gave the reins 
                    of the compagny to my sister and I. <br>Now we still have the same love for teaching and the beauty of mother nature but we also grew what our family gave 
                    to us and expand our business. In just two year, we were able to grow in size and hire three new guides who know this river like the back of their hand
                    to make you enjoy white river rafting in total security.
