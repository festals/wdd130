        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>With the new influx of holidaymakers in our wonderful part of the world, we decided after careful consideration, to take our family business online, to rejuvenate our image. To make our online presence seen we decided to make this website to present to the world our small place of paradise on hearth, where you can feel the adrenaline pumping through your veins while enjoying a beautiful scenery and turquoise water, all that rafting through incredible canyon.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Who are the target for rafting? Every year on spring break or when it is time to go on summer vacation, a lot of young people ask themselves, what are we going to do to take our minds off of our study? Don't look further.
            What can you expect from this activity? If you love adventure and outdoor activities, are ready to make life long memories with your friends and are tired of the traditional beach vacation, you find the right place. 
            What are you going to find on this website?
